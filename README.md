# National Immunisation Survey-Child
Survey by NORC at University of Chicago is a comprehensive survey for public use. It has over 28k records of children and
any respiratory disease that they have encountered along with vaccine shots they have taken. Moreoever, every childs parental status such as education level
and maritial status is also kept in the records.
Using the records of Vaccination and childs disease history I was able to see effectiveness of certain vaccine and also find correlation of other factors on
the child's future of contracting a respiratory disease.
